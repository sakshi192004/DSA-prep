// Problem Statement: Given an array of length N, peak element is defined as the element greater than both of its neighbors. Formally, if arr[i] is the peak element, arr[i - 1] < arr[i] and arr[i + 1] < arr[i]. Find the index(0-based) of a peak element in the array. If there are multiple peak numbers, return the index of any peak number.

// Examples
// Input: arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,5,1}
// Output: 7
// Explanation: There is only 1 peak element, 8,  that is at index 7.
// Input: arr[] = {1,2,1,3,5,6,4} 
// Output: 1 
// Explanation : There are 2 peak numbers that are at indices 1 and 5. We can return any of them.

  for(int i=1;i<n-1;i++){
    if(arr[i]>arr[i-1]&&arr[i]>arr[i+1]){
      return i;
    }
  }

  int arr[]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,5,1};
